      <description>I am passionate about the intersection of research, psychology, data science, and web development.
I started as an undergraduate in cognitive psychology, and along the way, I developed a keen interest in methodology and statistics for social sciences. I am particularly interested in generalized linear models applied to psychopathological screening and personality and intelligence assessment. Among other things, I work with network and time series models. A big chunk of my daily work consists of designing and implementing complex simulation designs in R, Python, and C++.</description>
